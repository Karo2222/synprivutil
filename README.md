# Synthetic Data Privacy and Utility Framework

This project provides a python library for generating synthetic datasets and evaluating their privacy and utility. It includes tools for creating synthetic data, performing various privacy and utility analyses, and visualizing results through plots. The framework is designed to help researchers and developers assess the balance between data utility and privacy in synthetic datasets.
