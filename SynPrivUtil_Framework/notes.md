Some of my notes, ignore:

**Data Cleaning**
Handle Missing Values:

Identify and handle missing data by either imputing missing values, dropping missing records, (or: using models that can handle missing data.)
(For example: df.fillna(value, inplace=True) or df.dropna(inplace=True).)

Remove Duplicates:

no unintended duplicate rows (can distort the synthetic data generation.)
Example: df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True).

Correct Data Types:

each column has the appropriate data type (e.g., numeric, categorical, datetime) (for correct modeling and generating synthetic data)
for example: df['age'] = df['age'].astype(int). (guess the column type based on the data and look for entries that don't match the data type of the other values)

Handle Outliers:

identify/handle outliers which could skew the synthetic data generation process (depending on the context, remove or transform outliers?)
for example: df = df[df['column'] < threshold].


- Rewrite functions into classes? Make the code more general (?)
- New way of sd generation, combine different test parts into one example, especially clean up all of the csv files
- transformation (scaling, normalizing)

wasserstein-distance: change to multidimensional

- some new (privacy) metrics, adapt privacy metrics (weighted, privacy protection in different labels)
- limitations of existing metrics? (threshold, propose method of finding out what a threshold could be?), in niche datasets (let the user specify which columns are more important, whcih ones less important)
- different models, compare
- show evaluation of different synthetic data sets (generated by models, or downloaded synthetic datasets)
